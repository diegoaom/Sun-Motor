# Scenario - Custom Sales Territory Management

Sun Motors Inc. is experiencing exponential sales growth after releasing their Model F solar powered sports car. 

They employ a Sales team that sells vehicles to auto dealers across the United States. Each sales representative has a territory of one or more zip codes. Sales reps own the relationship with all auto dealers in their zip code territories.

Sun Motors Inc. currently uses Salesforce to track their sales activities, including:
Accounts: Each account represents an automobile dealer.
Opportunities: A sale of vehicles to an automobile dealer.
Contacts: Automobile dealer employees.

The Sales Operations team uses a combination of Salesforce and spreadsheets to manage each sales rep’s territory. They are manually setting the Account Owner field to the sales rep’s User record when the Account’s Zip Code belongs to the sales rep. 

Since Sun Motors Inc.’s sales team has tripled in size in the past year, the Sales Operations team is having trouble keeping up with all the sales territory changes. This process must be automated!
